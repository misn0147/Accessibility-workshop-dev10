- [ ] Match the label’s for="" attribute with the input’s id="" attribute. OR wrap the input in the label
- [ ] use fieldset to break up longer forms and legend to make it clear what each section of the form is for

- [ ] Provide special instructions to screen readers via aria-labels if necessary 
- [ ] Errors are displayed in a list above the form after submission
- [ ] Associate input error messaging with input it corresponds to
- [ ] Make sure error, warning and success are inidcated by more than just colour
